Thank you for using BotTweeter!

DISCLAIMER
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. This version of BT is compatible with Python 3.7 but hasn't been tested with
   other versions. I'm assuming that if you're running Python 3.x everything should 
   run smoothly anyways but i can't guarantee anything. If BT crashes for you even 
   on Python 3.7 contact me with the error and I'll take a look at it.

2. BT was made to run on APIv1, I havent worked on anything APIv2 related so to be
   quite frank I'm not sure whether or not BT is compatible with APIv2. If you are
   running it on APIv2 though, keep in mind that your project will need essential
   access or whatever they call it.
