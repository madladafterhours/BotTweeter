DISCLAIMER
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BT was made to run on APIv1, I havent worked on anything APIv2 related so to be
quite frank I'm not sure whether or not BT is compatible with APIv2. If you are
running it on APIv2 though, keep in mind that your project will need essential
access or whatever they call it.
