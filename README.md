DISCLAIMER
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BT was made to run on APIv1, I'm pretty sure (but not certain) that it works on
APIv2 natively though. If you're getting authentication errors after verifying
that the tokens are correct, the API version used is most likely the issue.
